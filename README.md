code poetry

I have so much to say in this readme.

I wanted to do my code poetry in TempleOS. 

TempleOS, breifly, was an operating system single handedly made by Terry Davis.

Terry Davis was a genius - he made this operating system, a compiler, and a (semi unique) coding language, and he did it alone and from scratch.

Terry Davis also was a schizophrenic and very mentally ill, as well as extremely racist and biggoted. 

I knew he was mentally ill going into this project, I did not know how terrible some of the things he said and did were.

I know it is impossible to 'separate the art from the artist' but this truly is a special case study of this true genius who was his own worst nightmare.

Anyways

TempleOS was an operating system built by instructions given to Terry by God, and it was made with a sole purpose to communicate with God. 

It is God's temple.

The coding language is HolyC - God's version of C.


Setting TempleOS up was a nightmare. Terry died last year and though all of his youtube videos and software and emails and etc were archived, it was still very difficult to find complete versions of the software. Even after many many hours of trials and tribulations I had to find a supplementary disk with other things from the operating system I knew where originally in the system, but not on the system I had downloaded.

So TempleOS only exists in iso files and can only be run off a virtual machine. I was using VMware, which does not support speakers, so all of the hymns Terry wrote and coded into TempleOS have not been heard by me. I have plans on downloading a new virtual machine (QEMU) soon so I can test that. I had to switch out multiple iso files within the virtual machine to get all of the games / files that I know of and wanted to check out. I can't even image how much more is out there.


For this repository, I have included videos of me doing some basic things in TempleOS that are the most poem-like, considering this is supposed to be a project on code poetry. I kind of think that literally every key stroke I make or more broadly, every part of TempleOS, is art and poetry if you put it in the context that by using that OS, I am in direct communication with God. 

But I digress

Here are videos of woeful quality, because the lord had to declare that his temple was 640x480 resolution.

video1.mp4 shows me going into templeOS and first calling the bible <ctrl alt b> which opens up the whole bible split into indices.
  
video2.mp4 shows me calling the keyboard short cuts "gods passage" <shift F7>, "gods word" <F7> (which was freaks which made me crack up), and "gods doodle" <shift F6>. (all of these are poems)
  
video3.mp4 shows me in one of the mini games called "after egypt". In this game you can go to God and talk to him, as you are his puppet, and with each click he tells an oracle that only Terry Davis can find the meaning in. (I consider this one of the poems too)

video4.mp4 shows me going into a text file called HappyWords.txt that I will expand on below.


To have something real to turn in however, I searched for the HappyWords.txt online since I don't really have any way to get the files off of the iso files because they are all unable to be unzipped or archived and my external disk drive is a broken piece of garbage. Thankfullly some dedicated githubber had the supplemental files uploaded and I was able to copy over all the Happy Words into a text file. I then read in that text file word by word in a python file and put all the words in a list and printed five of those words at random to create a poem. 

So you can just look at this as a big file with a lot of dumb words / phrases (also some may be problematic, I didn't read through all the words so if you happen to get a bad word pop up I am very sorry) that make some stupid sounding poem. But in the context I think it's an absolutely whack piece of art. TempleOS is buck wild and I wish we had more time with this project so I could have written this code in HolyC, but with only a week and such tough installation, I had to resort to writing a three minute python code. Maybe one day I will have this poem generator as a HolyC file in my TempleOS Home directory. Just not today.
